        <h2>Erin Wilson, Jiatao Cheng, and Adam Canady</h2>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>This project is entitled the "Room Finder Extraordinaire". It takes various inputs and returns lists of rooms or a categorical probability of successfully drawing a particular room. We used data from previous Carleton room draws, and added geolocation from coordinates in Google Maps.
        </p>

        <p>Throughout this project, we leveraged our knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and JavaScript on the client side as well as Python, PostgreSQL (and its Python connector, psycopg2), and a pre-configured Apache install on the server side.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals and Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Goal: to provide Carleton students with an application that will assist them in the room draw process based on previous room draw data</li>
            <li>Feature: Find all rooms given certain specifications</li>
            <li>Feature: Find rooms within certain ranges of a draw number, indicating the probability that the number will get that room</li>
            <li>Feature: Find rooms near a certain location on campus</li>
            <li>Feature: Find rooms furthest away from another person's probable draw given their draw number</li>
            <li>We responded to feedback by adding a feature that lists all the available rooms given certain specifications</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Helpful Information</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, it would have been great to have a "demo day" where we were minimally introduced to some of the critical technologies behind this software. After we had developed most of our project, we talked in class about JavaScript, Asynchronosity and JSON, however, we never covered SQL or CSS, both of which played a critical role in our final product.</p>
